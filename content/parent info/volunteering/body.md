### Kingswood RFC Ethos
As a club driven by the passion and dedication of our community, we want to share some important information about how we operate:

### Volunteer-Driven
Our club is entirely run by volunteers, from those serving in the kitchen to our dedicated coaches. Their commitment ensures that we can provide a fantastic experience for all our players and families.

### Your Involvement
To keep our club running smoothly, we rely on the collective effort of all members. We ask every family to pitch in and help wherever possible. This could be assisting with kitchen duties, helping to set up on match days, or supporting various club activities.

### Kitchen Duty Rota
To make this manageable, we have implemented a kitchen duty rota. Each age group will be responsible for kitchen duties only twice a season. This system ensures that the workload is fairly distributed and that everyone gets a chance to contribute without it becoming overwhelming.

We believe that with everyone's support, we can continue to foster a strong, vibrant community that benefits all our players. Thank you for your cooperation and enthusiasm in making Kingswood Rugby Club a wonderful place for our children to grow and enjoy the sport.
