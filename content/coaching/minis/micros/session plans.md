## **Session Structure (30–45 Minutes)**  

### **Warm-Up (5–10 minutes)**  
**Objective:** Prepare children physically and mentally while introducing basic movement skills.  
- **Game:** *Freeze Tag*  
  - Children run around a designated area. When tagged by a coach or peer, they must freeze and hold a rugby pose (e.g., hugging an imaginary ball).  
  - Encourage running, stopping quickly, and changing directions.

### **Skill Activity 1: Ball Familiarity (10 minutes)**  
**Objective:** Develop basic ball-handling and coordination.  
- **Drill:** *Treasure Hunt*  
  - Scatter rugby balls (or other soft balls) around the field.  
  - Children run to pick up a ball, carry it to a "treasure chest" (marked area), and return to find another.  
  - Progression: Add challenges, such as balancing the ball on one hand or passing it to a partner before placing it in the chest.

### **Skill Activity 2: Movement and Evasion (10 minutes)**  
**Objective:** Improve agility and spatial awareness.  
- **Game:** *Sharks and Minnows*  
  - One child (or coach) is the "shark" in the middle of the pitch. Others ("minnows") try to run from one side to the other without being tagged.  
  - Tagged players become sharks until only one minnow remains.

### **Team Play: Small Group Activity (10 minutes)**  
**Objective:** Encourage teamwork and passing.  
- **Activity:** *Pass the Parcel*  
  - Split children into small groups.  
  - They pass a rugby ball around their circle while music plays. When the music stops, the child holding the ball gets to shout a fun rugby cheer.  
  - Progression: Introduce sideways or backward passing and short relays.

### **Cool-Down and Reflection (5 minutes)**  
**Objective:** Wind down and celebrate successes.  
- Light stretching combined with positive feedback.  
- Gather the group and ask, “What was your favorite part of today?”

## **Adaptation by Week**  
### Example Adjustments for Training Cycles:  
- **Weeks 1–6:** Focus on ball familiarity and fun evasion games like *Sharks and Minnows.*  
- **Weeks 7–12:** Introduce simple passing concepts in *Pass the Parcel.*  
- **Weeks 13–18:** Incorporate tag belts in movement games to introduce tagging lightly.  
- **Weeks 19–24:** Add team-based challenges, like placing a ball together in a goal area, to encourage collaboration.  

This session plan ensures young children build foundational rugby skills while fostering a love for the game in an enjoyable, supportive environment.
